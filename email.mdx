# Email

Connect a mailbox once and let your Telogenesis employees read, triage, and reply as if they were on the team. Mailboxes are managed through the dashboard with a secure OAuth flow powered by Nylas.

## Requirements

- An email account that can be connected through OAuth. Google accounts are fully supported today; Microsoft support is in private preview.
- At least one employee with the `email` tool category enabled.
- An organization selected in the dashboard header so the connection is stored in the correct workspace.

## Connect an inbox

1. Navigate to `Email` in the sidebar.
2. Click **Connect account**. The dashboard generates a one time state token and redirects you to the provider consent screen.
3. Approve the requested scopes. After the provider redirects back to the dashboard you will see a success toast and the account in the **Connected Accounts** list.

## Assign the mailbox to employees

1. In the `Email` page, locate the connected account.
2. Use the dropdown to choose which employees can send and receive mail from that address. You can assign the mailbox to multiple employees.
3. The dashboard stores the mapping so future conversations automatically route to the selected employees.

## Working email threads

- Employees see email history, generate replies, and send outbound messages using the connected mailbox address.
- Every message is visible in the dashboard. Open the employee record or the email module to monitor drafts, review sent items, or revoke access.
- The same guidance and personality settings you configured on the employee apply to email replies.

## Troubleshooting

- If the OAuth redirect returns an error banner, reconnect the account and validate the user has the correct provider permissions.
- Newly connected accounts may take a minute to sync. Refresh the dashboard if the inbox list looks stale.
- To remove access, use the `Delete` option on the account row. The dashboard revokes the Nylas grant and stops future email access instantly.
