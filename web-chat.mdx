# Web Chat

Web chat is the fastest way to collaborate with an employee. Replies stream in real time, you can iterate on guidance safely, and every session is stored for future review.

## Start a conversation

1. Click `Chat` in the sidebar to open the chat list.
2. Choose an existing conversation or select an employee and hit **Create Chat** to start a new thread.
3. Use the composer to send instructions, attachments, or follow ups. Messages appear instantly, and you can watch the assistant think and respond.

## Manage chats

- Rename, refresh, or delete conversations from the chat list. Bulk actions are available when you select multiple threads.
- Each chat links back to the employee record so you can update personality, tooling, or guidance without leaving the session.
- The chat transcript persists, giving you a searchable history when you need to review decisions or provide feedback.

## Best practices

- Use chat to validate instructions before handing the employee a live email or SMS contact.
- Keep long running projects in a dedicated thread to maintain context. The assistant keeps its internal memory updated as the conversation evolves.
- When things look off, refresh the chat to pull the latest state from the backend and confirm the dashboard is synced.
