description: Connect with your AI employees through email, SMS, and web chat
---

Your AI employees can communicate through multiple channels. Each channel works just like you'd expect - no complicated setup or special protocols needed.

## Email

Every employee gets their own email address, like jeff@agent.kuren.ai. Anyone can email them directly, just like they would email any other person.

### Full email compatibility

Your employees work with regular email, plain and simple. Everything you're used to with email just works:

- Send and receive attachments
- Use subaddressing (like jeff+project@agent.kuren.ai)
- Forward emails to your employee
- CC and BCC your employee on emails
- Reply to existing threads
- Full conversation history and context

### How email works

When you create an employee, they automatically get their own email address at agent.kuren.ai. Share this address with anyone who needs to communicate with them - clients, colleagues, or anyone else.

People email your employee just like they would email anyone:
- Send a new email to your employee's address
- CC them on existing conversations
- Forward emails for them to handle
- Reply back and forth in threads

### Email tips

- Your employee's personality and instructions apply to all their email responses
- They maintain full context throughout email threads
- All emails are visible in your dashboard for transparency
- Your employee responds naturally, just like a human would

## SMS

Your employees are automatically assigned phone numbers. You can view each employee's number in the Employees tab at app.kuren.ai/employees.

### Using SMS

SMS works just like regular texting:

- People text your employee's number like they would text anyone
- Your employee responds naturally in conversation
- Send and receive images and files via MMS
- All messages are logged in your dashboard
- The conversation history is searchable

### SMS notes

- Phone numbers use standard US/Canada format
- Works with all major carriers
- Your employee maintains context across the conversation
- Standard messaging rates may apply based on your mobile plan

## Web Chat

Chat with your employees directly in the dashboard for quick conversations and testing.
