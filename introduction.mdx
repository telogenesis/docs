# What is Telogenesis

Telogenesis is a platform that lets you configure and interact with AI Employees - in particular, executive assistants. They do the things you don't want to do - scheduling meetings, booking dinner reservations, routine market research, and more.

## The Basics

What is your Telogenesis agent? We want you to think of it like a substitute for a remote employee. You can talk to it over text and email, you can share your google docs and google calendars with it, it can search the web for you, do simple things like book dinner reservations, remind you of things, create calendar invites, perform research, etc, etc, etc. It can do almost anything that a human with a laptop can do!

## Supported Features

### Communication

Right now, there are three good ways for you to communicate with your agents. You can text them from your phone, you can send them emails, and you can chat with them through the [web app](https://https://dashboard.telogenesis.ai/chat).

### Integrations

#### Google Docs

#### Google Calendar

#### Web search

Your Telogenesis agents can search the web, just like you can. This is powered by [Exa](exa.ai)

#### Web Browsing

All Telogenesis agents have access to a web browser, powered by [Browserbase](browserbase.com). 

## Popular Use Cases

### ChatGPT over Email and Text 

You can treat your employees like ChatGPT hooked up to email and SMS, because that's kind of what it is. Need suggestions for how to reply to an email? Forward it to your assistant and ask for them! Want suggestions for restaurants near you? Text your EA, and see what he thinks!
