# Support

We are standing by if you or your employees run into trouble. Reach out using any of the options below and include as much context as you can (organization name, employee involved, timestamps, and any relevant screenshots).

## Email

- Send a note to `support@telogenesis.ai` for anything that is not urgent.
- The inbox is monitored throughout the week. You will receive an acknowledgment within one business day.

## SMS

- Text Ryan (Telogenesis founder) at `972-571-7223` for urgent questions or if the dashboard is blocking you from getting work done.
- Please mention your organization name in the first message so we can verify your account quickly.

If the issue affects multiple customers or looks security related, use both channels. We will coordinate with you to resolve the problem as fast as possible.
