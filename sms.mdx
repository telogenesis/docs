# SMS

Keep text conversations running through Telnyx numbers that belong to your organization. Each employee can send and receive messages from an assigned number, and every conversation stays visible in the dashboard.

## Requirements

- Telogenesis provisions at least one SMS capable Telnyx number for every organization.
- The employee must have the `sms` tool category enabled when you create or edit them.
- Team members who expect to receive texts from an employee should add a personal phone number and opt in under `Settings -> User Settings`.

## Check available numbers

1. Open `Numbers` in the dashboard sidebar.
2. Review the list of active Telnyx numbers, including the employee assignment and the date the number was added.
3. Need another area code or a dedicated line? Email `support@telogenesis.ai` with the request and the team will allocate a new number.

## Assign a number to an employee

1. Go to `Employees` and choose the employee you want to update.
2. Scroll to **Assigned Phone Numbers** to review existing lines.
3. Use the assignment controls to link an available Telnyx number to the employee. The change takes effect immediately.

## Day to day operations

- Employees automatically log inbound and outbound SMS threads. Open the employee detail view to review, scrub, or delete conversations when needed.
- Conversations use the same E.164 number, so contacts see a single continuous thread.
- Combine SMS with email or web chat. The employee keeps context across channels and uses memory or todo tools you have enabled.

## Troubleshooting

- If a number does not appear in the dashboard, refresh the page or ask support to confirm the Telnyx provisioning completed.
- Messages cannot send if the organization selected in the header does not match the employee's org.
- Make sure downstream recipients have opted in to SMS and that carrier filtering guidelines are respected.
